## Queuing api 

## Node.js application with Nginx proxy and Redis database


The compose file defines an application with four services `redis`, `nginx`, `web1` and `web2`.
When deploying the application, docker compose maps port 80 of the nginx service container to port 80 of the host as specified in the file.

## Starting the services 

Run `docker compose up`

## Curl examples

Fetch a  payload froma queue with a 5 seconds timeout while measuring elapsed time 
`time curl -v  'http://localhost/api/queue_4?timeout=5000'`
